## 1. Why Medical AI? Why Federated Learning?

### The Medical AI Challenge
Medical imaging — X-rays, CT scans, MRIs — generates enormous volumes of data daily across hospitals worldwide. Deep learning models trained on this data can assist radiologists, detect subtle patterns, and reduce diagnostic errors. However, training accurate models requires **large, diverse datasets** spanning multiple institutions, scanners, and patient demographics.

### The Privacy Wall
Medical data is among the most strictly regulated data on Earth:
- **HIPAA** (United States) prohibits sharing of Protected Health Information (PHI) without explicit consent.
- **GDPR** (European Union) enforces the right to data minimization and purpose limitation.
- **Hospital policies** across India, Asia, and the developing world impose institutional data sovereignty.

Traditional centralized training requires **pooling raw patient data** from multiple hospitals into a single server — a direct privacy violation. Even anonymization is insufficient; MRI scans can be re-identified through brain structure uniqueness.

### Federated Learning: The Solution
**Federated Learning (FL)** decouples model training from data centralization:

1. A **central server** holds a global model and broadcasts it to all participating hospitals (clients).
2. Each hospital **trains the model locally** on its own private data — raw images never leave the hospital.
3. Each hospital sends only **model weight updates** (not data) back to the server.
4. The server **aggregates** these weight updates into an improved global model.
5. Repeat for many communication rounds until convergence.

This architecture preserves patient privacy by design — no raw medical data ever crosses institutional boundaries.

### The Non-IID Problem
In practice, hospitals differ dramatically:
- **Scanner variation:** Different MRI machines produce different image characteristics.
- **Patient demographics:** Hospitals in different regions see different tumor type distributions.
- **Dataset size:** A large teaching hospital may have 10× more labeled scans than a rural clinic.
- **Class imbalance:** One hospital may see mostly gliomas; another may specialize in pituitary tumors.

This creates **Non-IID (Non-Identically and Independently Distributed)** data across clients. Standard FL aggregation (FedAvg) struggles with Non-IID data because simple averaging of divergent weight updates can cancel out learned features, causing the global model to underperform for minority clients.

**This is the core research question:** *Can we design a smarter aggregation algorithm that handles Non-IID medical data more equitably than FedAvg?*

## 2. Why Brain Tumor Classification?

### Clinical Significance
Brain tumors account for ~2% of all cancers but have disproportionately high mortality. Accurate classification of tumor type from MRI is critical for treatment planning:
- **Glioma:** Most aggressive — requires immediate surgical consideration. Misclassification is potentially fatal.
- **Meningioma:** Generally benign — misclassifying as glioma leads to unnecessary invasive procedures.
- **Pituitary:** Typically treated with medication — correct identification avoids surgery.
- **No Tumor:** The healthy baseline — false positives cause patient anxiety and unnecessary follow-up.

### Why This Task Is Ideal for FL Research
1. **Multiple real-world datasets exist** (Masoud, BRISC) with natural distribution differences — providing genuine Non-IID conditions.
2. **4-class classification** is complex enough to expose aggregation differences but tractable for systematic experimentation.
3. **Clinical stakes are high** — fairness across hospitals matters because patients at any hospital deserve equitable diagnostic support.
4. **Precedent exists** — Sheller et al. (2020) demonstrated FL for brain tumor *segmentation* on BraTS. Our work extends to *classification* with a novel aggregation strategy.

## 3. Datasets and Client Architecture

### Source Datasets

| Dataset | Source | Classes | Total Images |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Masoud Brain Tumor MRI** | Kaggle (masoudnickparvar) | Glioma, Meningioma, No Tumor, Pituitary | ~7,000 |
| **BRISC 2025** | Kaggle (briscdataset) | Glioma, Meningioma, No Tumor, Pituitary | ~5,000 |

### Client Assignment (Simulating 3 Hospitals)

| Client | Dataset Source | Train | Val | Test | Nature |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Client 1** | Masoud (Testing split) | 1,119 | 240 | 241 | **Smallest**, balanced |
| **Client 2** | BRISC 2025 | 3,499 | 750 | 751 | Mid-size, slight imbalance |
| **Client 3** | Masoud (Training split) | 3,919 | 840 | 841 | **Largest**, balanced |
| **Global Test** | Combined test splits | — | — | **1,833** | Stratified across all |

**Global test class distribution:** Glioma 442, Meningioma 470, No Tumor 432, Pituitary 489.

> **Privacy Design:** Data never crosses client boundaries. Non-IID conditions are created by subsampling *within* each client's own dataset, preserving the FL privacy guarantee.

### Heterogeneity Conditions

**Setup 1 — Natural Heterogeneity:**
Clients retain their natural data distributions from separate real-world sources. Heterogeneity arises from dataset-level differences — scanner variation, image quality, and slight class imbalances between sources. Client 1 is 3.5× smaller than Client 3.

**Setup 2 — Moderate Label Skew (70/10/10/10):**
Each client's training data is artificially restructured: 70% of samples belong to one dominant class, 10% each to the remaining three. This is the hardest test condition — maximum class distribution shift across clients.
- Client 1 → 70% Glioma
- Client 2 → 70% Meningioma
- Client 3 → 70% No Tumor

## 4. Aggregation Approach 1: FedAvg

**Federated Averaging (McMahan et al., 2017)** is the baseline aggregation algorithm for FL.

### Algorithm
```
For each round r = 1, ..., R:
    1. Broadcast global model w_global to all K clients
    2. Each client k trains locally for E epochs on private data D_k
    3. Each client returns updated weights w_k
    4. Server aggregates: w_global = Σ (n_k / N) × w_k
       where n_k = |D_k| and N = Σ n_k
```

### Properties
- **Deterministic:** Given the same client updates, always produces the same result.
- **Stateless:** No memory of past rounds — each aggregation is independent.
- **Size-weighted:** Larger datasets get proportionally more influence.

### Limitation Under Non-IID
The weighted average is dominated by large clients. Client 3 (3,919 samples) has ~3.5× the influence of Client 1 (1,119 samples). Under label skew, this means the global model systematically favours the data distribution of the largest clients and ignores the smallest.

---

## 5. Aggregation Approach 2: FedProx

**FedProx (Li et al., 2020)** extends FedAvg by adding a proximal regularization term to the client loss function.

### Algorithm
```
Client local training loss:
    L_FedProx = L_local + (μ/2) × ||w_local − w_global||²

Server aggregation: Same as FedAvg (weighted average)
```

### Properties
- **Regularization parameter μ = 0.01** penalizes clients for drifting too far from the global model.
- **Goal:** Prevent large clients from "pulling" the global model toward their own distribution.
- **Limitation:** The proximal term constrains *all* clients equally. It doesn't redistribute influence — it merely slows everyone down. Under severe Non-IID, it can prevent clients from properly adapting to their own local data.

---

## 6. Aggregation Approach 3: Naive QPSO (Whole-Model)

### What is QPSO?
**Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (Sun et al., 2004)** is a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm inspired by quantum mechanics. Each candidate solution is a "particle" in a high-dimensional search space. Particles are attracted toward:
- Their **personal best** position (pbest) — the best solution each particle has ever found.
- The **global best** position (gbest) — the best solution any particle has ever found.

The quantum-inspired update uses a logarithmic distribution to allow "tunneling" — particles can jump to distant regions of the search space, escaping local optima.

### Naive QPSO for FL (Phases 1–3)

In our initial implementation, QPSO was applied at the **whole-model level** after each FL round:

```
For each FL round:
    1. Distribute global model → clients
    2. Each client trains locally
    3. Each client reports: (weights, val_accuracy)
    4. Update pbest/gbest based on val_accuracy
    5. Apply QPSO formula to ENTIRE model simultaneously:
       For each parameter θ:
           φ ~ U(0,1), u ~ U(0.3, 1.0)
           p = φ × mean(pbests) + (1−φ) × gbest
           step = β × |mbest − θ| × ln(1/u) × sign
           θ_new = p + clamp(step, -0.1, 0.1)
    6. No fitness evaluation of the resulting model
```

### Why Naive QPSO Failed

| Problem | Consequence |
|---|---|
| **No fitness evaluation** | The perturbed model is never tested — blind perturbation can destroy the learned weights |
| **Whole-model perturbation** | Simultaneously perturbing 120K+ parameters at once creates chaotic weight combinations |
| **Only 1 QPSO step per round** | Not enough iterations to converge toward any useful direction |
| **Accuracy-based fitness** | Using client-reported accuracy (not actual loss) provides coarse, noisy guidance |
| **Clamped perturbation [-0.1, 0.1]** | The safety clamp was necessary to prevent NaN but effectively reduces QPSO to "FedAvg + tiny noise" |
| **Clamped u ∈ [0.3, 1.0]** | Further restricts the quantum jump magnitude |

**Result:** In Phase 3 (Lightweight CNN), Naive QPSO achieved only **77.3% accuracy** under label skew compared to FedAvg's **90.56%** — a catastrophic **13.26 percentage point deficit**. The algorithm was destroying learned features rather than optimizing them.

---

## 7. Aggregation Approach 4: Layer-by-Layer QPSO (The Contribution)

### The Key Insight
The original MNIST QPSO implementation (Edla, 2025) that achieved remarkable performance (QPSO: 81.5% vs FedAvg: 41.2%) used a fundamentally different approach: **layer-by-layer optimization with validation-loss fitness evaluation**.

### Algorithm (Faithfully Ported from MNIST Reference)

```
For each FL round:
    1. Broadcast global model → all clients
    2. Each client trains locally for 1 epoch
    3. Collect all K client weight dictionaries
    4. Compute FedAvg baseline (covers BatchNorm running stats)
    5. Prepare combined validation set from all clients (1,830 samples)
    6. FOR EACH of 16 trainable parameter tensors independently:
       a. Extract this layer's weights from each client → particles
       b. Evaluate initial fitness = validation LOSS for each particle
          (set only this layer, keep rest at FedAvg → forward pass → cross-entropy loss)
       c. For 5 QPSO iterations:
          - Compute mbest = mean of all personal bests
          - For each particle i:
            · φ ~ U(0,1)
            · p = φ × pbest_i + (1−φ) × gbest           (attractor)
            · u ~ U(ε, 1), sign = random ±1
            · step = β × |mbest − x_i| × ln(1/u) × sign  (quantum jump)
            · new_pos = p + step
            · Evaluate fitness: insert new_pos for this layer → forward pass → get loss
            · If loss < pbest_loss: update pbest
            · If loss < gbest_loss: update gbest
       d. Commit gbest (best weight tensor found) for this layer
    7. Assembled global model = all 16 layers at their gbest values
```

### Why This Works

| Design Choice | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Layer-by-layer** | Reduces search space from 120K to ~300–65K parameters per optimization step |
| **Validation-loss fitness** | Every candidate solution is evaluated by actually running the model — no blind perturbation |
| **5 iterations per layer** | Enough iterations to converge toward genuinely better weight configurations |
| **Loss-based (minimize)** | Continuous loss signal is smoother and more informative than discrete accuracy |
| **Unclamped perturbation** | Full quantum exploration range — matches the MNIST reference implementation |
| **Static β = 0.6** | Proven effective in the MNIST reference; balances exploration and exploitation |
| **Combined validation set** | Fitness evaluated on data from ALL clients — automatically penalizes solutions that fail any client |

### The Fairness Mechanism (Key Scientific Insight)
The combined validation set used for fitness evaluation contains samples from all three clients equally. This means:
- A weight configuration that achieves low loss for Clients 2 and 3 but high loss for Client 1 will score **poorly** overall.
- QPSO naturally searches for weights that minimize loss **across all clients simultaneously**.
- This creates an **implicit fairness constraint** — no explicit fairness objective is needed.

## 8. Experimental Progression: Phases 1–4

The following table summarizes the entire experimental journey. Each phase was designed to isolate a specific variable.

| Phase | Case Name | Architecture | Params | QPSO Type | β | Status | Key Finding |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1** | Transfer Learning | ResNet-18 (ImageNet) | 11.18M | Naive (whole-model) | 0.7 | ✅ | Pretrained weights mask all aggregation differences (~98.5%) |
| **Phase 2** | No Pretrained | ResNet-18 (scratch) | 11.18M | Naive (whole-model) | 0.7 | ✅ | Model capacity still too high (~97.5–98.7%) |
| **Phase 3** | Lightweight CNN | SimpleCNN (scratch) | ~120K | Naive (whole-model) | 1.0→0.5 | ✅ | Naive QPSO **crashed** (77.3% vs FedAvg 90.6%) |
| **Phase 4** | Layer-by-Layer QPSO | SimpleCNN (scratch) | ~120K | **Layer-by-layer** | 0.6 | ✅ | QPSO **recovered** (92.1%), best fairness, p=2.9×10⁻²² |

### Phase 1 & 2 Results Summary (ResNet-18)

| Metric | Phase 1 FedAvg | Phase 1 FedProx | Phase 1 QPSO | Phase 2 FedAvg | Phase 2 FedProx | Phase 2 QPSO |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Best Acc (Natural) | 98.96% | **99.13%** | 98.80% | **99.02%** | 98.69% | 98.58% |
| Best Acc (Mod. Skew) | 98.58% | **98.75%** | 98.04% | **98.25%** | 98.15% | 97.71% |
| Client σ (Natural) | **1.06%** | 1.15% | 1.17% | 1.53% | **1.44%** | 1.64% |
| Statistical sig. | — | ❌ (all p>0.05) | ❌ | — | ❌/✅ mixed | ❌ |

**Conclusion from Phases 1–2:** ResNet-18 is overpowered for 4-class brain tumor classification. Its 11.18 million parameters saturate the task regardless of aggregation strategy. No meaningful differences between algorithms.

### Phase 3 Results (SimpleCNN — Naive QPSO)

| Metric | Natural FedAvg | Natural FedProx | Natural Naive QPSO | Skew FedAvg | Skew FedProx | Skew Naive QPSO |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Best Acc (%) | **95.80** | 96.07 | 85.71 | **90.56** | 93.02 | 77.30 |
| Final Acc (%) | **92.53** | 92.47 | 82.87 | 88.16 | **91.82** | 72.67 |
| Client σ | 7.66% | 6.67% | **0.43%** | 12.82% | 6.05% | 9.35% |
| p-value vs FedAvg | — | 0.47 ❌ | 1.5×10⁻²³ ✅ | — | 5.9×10⁻²⁴ ✅ | 4.3×10⁻¹³ ✅ |

**Conclusion from Phase 3:** Naive QPSO statistically significantly **underperforms** FedAvg (negative Cohen's d = −1.32). Blind whole-model perturbation destroys learned weights. However, interestingly, Naive QPSO achieves the lowest client standard deviation (0.43%) in the natural setup — foreshadowing the fairness finding.

| **Macro Avg** | **0.9518** | **0.9513** | **0.9515** | 1833 |

> **Key observation:** QPSO achieves the **highest Glioma recall** (0.9593) — the most clinically critical tumor type. Missed gliomas are potentially fatal.

### 9.3 Per-Client Validation Accuracy

| | FedAvg | FedProx | QPSO-FL |
|---|---|---|---|
| Client 1 (final) | 83.75% | 91.25% | **92.08%** |
| Client 2 (final) | 86.13% | **95.33%** | 95.87% |
| Client 3 (final) | **95.95%** | 96.55% | 94.40% |
| **Std Dev** | 5.28% | 2.27% | **1.56%** |
| **Max − Min Gap** | 12.20pp | 5.30pp | **2.32pp** |

| | FedAvg (r83) | FedProx (r91) | QPSO-FL (r89) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Client 1 (at peak) | **75.00%** | 89.17% | **94.58%** |
| Client 2 (at peak) | 94.67% | 94.13% | 91.07% |

| **Std Dev at peak** | **9.50%** | 2.79% | **1.62%** |

> **Critical finding:** When FedAvg reached its peak global accuracy of 95.80%, Client 1 was simultaneously at **75.00%** — a 20pp gap. QPSO at its peak had all three clients within 3.5pp. Global accuracy alone is a misleading metric in federated settings.

| FedAvg vs FedProx | 1.7239 | 0.08792 | 0.1741 | ❌ No (p>0.05) |

> **Landmark result:** Under natural heterogeneity, QPSO is the **only method that statistically significantly outperforms FedAvg**. FedProx fails to reach significance (p=0.088).

| Client 2 (final) | 85.73% | 86.80% | **87.33%** |
| Client 3 (final) | 89.17% | **92.14%** | 88.10% |
| **Std Dev** | 12.82% | 6.05% | **3.65%** |
| **Max − Min Gap** | 28.75pp | 14.64pp | **8.10pp** |

| | FedAvg (r94) | FedProx (r89) | QPSO-FL (r98) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Client 1 (at peak) | **52.92%** | 62.92% | **80.83%** |
| **Std Dev at peak** | 13.38% | 12.07% | **4.23%** |

> **The most important number in this report:** At FedAvg's best global accuracy (90.56%), Client 1 was at **52.92%** — barely above random chance for a 4-class problem. At QPSO's best round, Client 1 was at **80.83%**. This is a **27.91 percentage point improvement** for the weakest hospital.

### 10.4 Client 1 Longitudinal Statistics

| Metric | FedAvg | FedProx | QPSO-FL |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mean across all rounds | 48.20% | 60.96% | **59.82%** |
| Maximum ever | 66.67% (r97) | 78.33% (r99) | **82.50%** (r99) |
| Below 70% | **100/100** (100%) | 76/100 (76%) | 74/100 (74%) |
| Below 60% | 90/100 (90%) | 37/100 (37%) | 43/100 (43%) |
| Late-stage mean (last 20r) | 55.96% | 68.40% | **74.31%** |

> **Under FedAvg, Client 1 never exceeded 70% accuracy in any of 100 rounds.** Its mean accuracy was 48.20% — random performance sustained for the entire experiment. This is a complete failure to serve the smallest, most imbalanced client.

### 10.5 Statistical Significance

| Comparison | t-statistic | p-value | Cohen's d | Significant |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FedAvg vs QPSO | 12.5859 | **2.91 × 10⁻²²** | 1.2586 | ✅ Yes (large effect) |
| FedAvg vs FedProx | 13.3946 | **5.86 × 10⁻²⁴** | 1.3395 | ✅ Yes (large effect) |

## 11. Naive QPSO vs Layer-by-Layer QPSO: The Critical Comparison

This comparison isolates the **algorithm design** as the only variable. Both use SimpleCNN (~120K params), 112×112 images, 1 local epoch, lr=0.01. The only difference is how QPSO aggregation is performed.

### 11.1 Accuracy Head-to-Head

| Metric | Naive QPSO (Phase 3) | Layer-by-Layer QPSO (Phase 4) | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Best Acc — Natural | 85.71% | **95.14%** | **+9.43pp** |
| Best Acc — Skew | 77.30% | **92.09%** | **+14.79pp** |
| Final Acc — Natural | 82.87% | **93.78%** | **+10.91pp** |
| Final Acc — Skew | 72.67% | **91.43%** | **+18.76pp** |

### 11.2 What Changed

| Parameter | Naive QPSO | Layer-by-Layer QPSO |
|---|---|---|
| Optimization scope | Entire model at once | **Per-layer (16 layers independently)** |
| Fitness evaluation | None (blind perturbation) | **Validation loss (forward pass)** |
| QPSO iterations | 1 per round | **5 per layer per round** |
| β | 1.0 → 0.5 (decay) | **0.6 (static)** |
| Perturbation clamp | ±0.5 | **None (unclamped)** |
| u clamp | [0.1, 1.0] | **[ε, 1.0]** |

### 11.3 The Lesson
The difference between a **+14.79pp improvement** and a **−13.26pp degradation** (compared to FedAvg under skew) is entirely attributable to the algorithm design. Layer-by-layer optimization with fitness evaluation transforms QPSO from destructive noise injection into a genuine optimization algorithm.

## 12. Cross-Setup Robustness Analysis

### Accuracy Degradation Under Label Skew

| Method | Setup 1 Best | Setup 2 Best | Drop |
|---|---|---|---|
| FedAvg | 95.80% | 90.56% | −5.24pp |
| FedProx | 96.13% | 93.02% | −3.11pp |
| QPSO-FL | 95.14% | 92.09% | **−3.05pp** |

QPSO is the **most robust to distribution shift** — its accuracy degradation under label skew (3.05pp) is the smallest.

### QPSO's Statistical Advantage Grows with Heterogeneity

| Setup | Cohen's d (QPSO vs FedAvg) | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Setup 1 (mild) | 0.35 | Small-medium effect |
| Setup 2 (severe) | **1.26** | Large effect |

The effect size more than **triples** as heterogeneity increases. This confirms the algorithm becomes more valuable precisely when data conditions are most challenging.

## 13. ROC-AUC Deep Dive

### Full AUC Table — Both Setups

| Class | S1 FedAvg | S1 FedProx | S1 QPSO | S2 FedAvg | S2 FedProx | S2 QPSO |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Glioma | 0.988 | 0.988 | **0.991** | 0.977 | 0.983 | **0.985** |
| Meningioma | 0.992 | **0.993** | 0.986 | 0.970 | **0.981** | 0.978 |
| No Tumor | 0.998 | **0.999** | 0.995 | 0.996 | **0.997** | **0.997** |
| Pituitary | **0.999** | **0.999** | 0.998 | 0.996 | **0.997** | **0.997** |
| **Micro Avg** | 0.995 | **0.996** | 0.993 | 0.986 | **0.991** | 0.990 |

### Key Observations
1. **QPSO wins Glioma AUC in both setups** (0.991 and 0.985) — the most critical tumor class.
2. **FedProx wins Meningioma AUC** (0.993 and 0.981) — the hardest class to classify.
3. **All methods achieve clinically excellent AUC > 0.97** for every class in both setups.
4. Under label skew, **FedAvg's Meningioma AUC drops most severely** (0.992 → 0.970), showing that the weighted average is most vulnerable for the hardest class.
5. AUC differences between methods are small (≤0.015) — all would be considered high-performing clinically. The differentiation comes from **per-client fairness**, not raw AUC.

## 14. Client Fairness: The Primary Scientific Finding

### 14.1 Why Fairness Matters in Federated Medical AI

In federated healthcare, clients represent **institutions — hospitals, imaging centres, or clinical sites**. A model that achieves 95% accuracy on average but 75% for one site and 98% for another is **clinically inequitable**. Patients at the underperforming site receive substantially worse diagnostic support than patients at the high-performing site. This is not a theoretical concern — it directly impacts patient outcomes.

### 14.2 Fairness Metrics Summary

**Client Standard Deviation (lower = fairer):**

| Setup | FedAvg | FedProx | QPSO-FL | QPSO improvement vs FedAvg |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Setup 1 | 5.28% | 2.27% | **1.56%** | −70.5% |
| Setup 2 | 12.82% | 6.05% | **3.65%** | −71.5% |

**Max-Min Client Gap (lower = fairer):**

| Setup | FedAvg | FedProx | QPSO-FL | QPSO reduction vs FedAvg |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Setup 1 | 12.20pp | 5.30pp | **2.32pp** | **−81%** |
| Setup 2 | 28.75pp | 14.64pp | **8.10pp** | **−72%** |

### 14.3 Fairness at Peak Performance

| | FedAvg at peak | FedProx at peak | QPSO at peak |
|---|---|---|---|
| Setup 1 Client Std Dev | 9.50% | 2.79% | **1.62%** |
| Setup 2 Client Std Dev | 13.38% | 12.07% | **4.23%** |

> Under label skew, FedProx's client std dev at its own best round (12.07%) is nearly as bad as FedAvg's (13.38%). FedProx achieves its accuracy leadership by **favouring certain clients**. QPSO's peak accuracy is distributed equitably (std dev 4.23%).

### 14.4 QPSO Reduces Disparity Against Both Baselines

| QPSO vs | Max-Min Gap Reduction (S1) | Max-Min Gap Reduction (S2) |
|---|---|---|
| vs FedAvg | **−81%** (12.20 → 2.32pp) | **−72%** (28.75 → 8.10pp) |
| vs FedProx | **−56%** (5.30 → 2.32pp) | **−45%** (14.64 → 8.10pp) |

### 14.5 The QPSO Fairness Advantage Grows with Heterogeneity

| Metric | Gap: QPSO vs FedProx (S1) | Gap: QPSO vs FedProx (S2) |
|---|---|---|
| Client Std Dev difference | −0.71pp | **−2.40pp** |

The harder the data conditions, the more QPSO's fairness advantage widens over FedProx. This indicates that the fitness evaluation mechanism becomes **more effective** as distribution shift worsens.

---

## 15. Stability and Convergence Analysis

### 15.1 Crash Resistance

| Metric | S1 FedAvg | S1 FedProx | S1 QPSO | S2 FedAvg | S2 FedProx | S2 QPSO |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Max single-round drop | −11.51pp | −8.46pp | **−2.45pp** | −14.78pp | −9.93pp | **−3.38pp** |
| Round-to-round std | ~4pp | ~4pp | **2.22pp** | 4.08pp | 4.25pp | **2.16pp** |

QPSO's **maximum crash across all 200 rounds** (both setups) is 3.38pp — smaller than FedAvg's crash in the *easier* natural heterogeneity condition (11.51pp).

### 15.2 Convergence Speed

| Setup | FedAvg | FedProx | QPSO |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rounds to 80% — Natural | 11 | 12 | **9** |
| Rounds to 80% — Skew | 35 | **17** | 19 |

QPSO converges fastest under natural heterogeneity. Under label skew, FedProx is marginally faster (17 vs 19 rounds).

---

## 16. Computational Cost Trade-offs

| | FedAvg | FedProx | QPSO |
|---|---|---|---|
| Avg Round Time (s) | ~8.0 | ~8.1 | **~75.0** |
| Total Training Time (min) | ~13.3 | ~13.5 | **~125.0** |
| Relative Compute Cost | 1× | 1.02× | **~9.4×** |

### QPSO Cost Breakdown (Per Round)
- 3 clients × 16 layers = 48 initial fitness evaluations
- 5 iterations × 3 particles × 16 layers = 240 QPSO step evaluations
- Total: ~288 forward passes per round (each on 4 mini-batches of 64 images)
- Hardware: Tesla P100-PCIE-16GB

### Cost-Benefit Summary

| What You Pay | What You Get |
|---|---|
| 9× more compute time (~2 hrs vs ~13 min) | Client fairness std dev halved vs FedProx |
| Compute burden on server only (not hospitals) | Weakest client accuracy +2.5–28pp vs baselines |
| — | Most stable accuracy curve (half the volatility) |
| — | Only method significantly better than FedAvg under natural heterogeneity |
| — | Best Glioma AUC and Glioma recall in both setups |
| **Trade-off** | FedProx achieves ~1pp higher peak accuracy at 1/9th the compute |

## 17. Clinical Relevance and Recall Analysis

### 17.1 Macro Recall (Lower = More Missed Diagnoses)

| | S1 FedAvg | S1 FedProx | S1 QPSO | S2 FedAvg | S2 FedProx | S2 QPSO |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Macro Recall | 0.9571 | **0.9607** | 0.9513 | 0.9050 | **0.9296** | 0.9203 |

FedProx achieves the highest macro recall overall.

### 17.2 Glioma Recall (Most Clinically Critical)

| | S1 FedAvg | S1 FedProx | S1 QPSO | S2 FedAvg | S2 FedProx | S2 QPSO |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Glioma Recall | 0.9118 | 0.9186 | **0.9593** | 0.8371 | 0.8620 | **0.8914** |

**QPSO achieves the highest Glioma recall in both setups.** For the most dangerous tumor type, QPSO misses the fewest cases. The gap under label skew is substantial: QPSO catches 89.14% of gliomas vs FedAvg's 83.71% — a potential difference of ~24 additional correctly identified glioma patients per 1000.

### 17.3 The Equity Argument

A hospital using FedAvg under label skew has Client 1 at 60.42% accuracy — meaning ~40% of cases are misclassified. A patient at Client 1 has drastically worse diagnostic support than a patient at Client 3 (89.17%). Under QPSO, the same patient at Client 1 benefits from 80.00% accuracy — crossing the threshold into clinical utility.

**QPSO is the only algorithm that keeps the worst-served client above 80% accuracy at convergence under label skew.**

---

21. **Catastrophic single-round crashes** — up to −14.78pp in one round
22. **Largest accuracy degradation under shift** — −5.24pp vs QPSO's −3.05pp

### Naive QPSO Conclusions
23. **Naive QPSO (Phases 1-3) is fundamentally broken** — blind whole-model perturbation destroys weights
24. **Layer-by-layer redesign recovered +14.79pp** under label skew (from 77.3% to 92.09%)
25. **The fitness evaluation was the key missing component** — without evaluating the result of perturbation, QPSO is just noise

### Experiment-Level Conclusions
26. **All methods are clinically viable** — AUC > 0.97 for every class in both setups
27. **The fairness-accuracy tradeoff is quantifiable** — ~1pp accuracy costs ~2–4pp client std dev
28. **Global accuracy is misleading in federated settings** — it can hide 28pp inter-client gaps
29. **QPSO's compute cost is its only unambiguous disadvantage**
30. **The compute burden falls on the server, not the hospitals** — this is architecturally acceptable

## 19. Paper Recommendation

### Best Angle: "Clinical Equity Through Fitness-Guided Aggregation"

Do **not** position this as "our algorithm gets 1% better accuracy." Position it as:

> *"Standard federated aggregation systematically fails minority hospitals. Under label skew, FedAvg gives the smallest hospital (Client 1) an accuracy of 60%, making the AI clinically dangerous for patients at that institution. Our Layer-by-Layer QPSO aggregation — which evaluates candidate weight configurations against balanced validation data from all clients — reduces the max-min performance gap by 72-81% and maintains ≥80% accuracy for every participating hospital. This makes QPSO-FL the only aggregation strategy suitable for equitable deployment across heterogeneous medical institutions."*

### Recommended Title
**"Layer-by-Layer QPSO Aggregation for Equitable Federated Brain Tumor Classification Across Heterogeneous Clinical Sites"**

### Key Contributions to Highlight
1. First application of layer-by-layer QPSO aggregation to non-IID federated medical image classification
2. Demonstration that fitness-evaluated aggregation naturally acts as a fairness mechanism
3. Quantification of the fairness-accuracy tradeoff between QPSO and FedProx
4. Evidence that QPSO's statistical significance grows with heterogeneity severity (d=0.35 → d=1.26)
5. Progressive experimental design (4 phases) proving that model capacity and algorithm design are independent variables

### Limitations to Acknowledge
1. Computational cost — 9× overhead limits real-time retraining frequency
2. Only 3 clients — fairness claims should be validated with more participants
3. SimpleCNN architecture — results may differ with deeper models
4. QPSO hyperparameters (β=0.6, 5 iterations) were fixed from MNIST reference, not tuned
5. Single random seed — run-to-run variance not reported
